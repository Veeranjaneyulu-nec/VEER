# Build in Public: EduAgent 🚀

**Headline:** Stop Tutorial Hell. Start Learning with an Agent. 🤖🎓

I just built **EduAgent**, a personalized learning platform that creates hyper-efficient study paths! 

**The Problem:** 
Most online courses are rigid. If you know "Basics of Programming", why watch 10 hours of "What is a Variable?" again?

**The Solution:**
EduAgent uses a **"ScaleDown"** algorithm to:
1.  **Analyze** your current skill gap (e.g., "I know HTML, teach me React").
2.  **Compress** 14,000+ course options into a lean, mean learning path.
3.  **Simulate** your career trajectory (New Feature!).

**🔥 Key Features:**
*   **Career Time Machine**: Interactive slider to see how studying 10h vs 30h/week impacts your "Salary Unlock Date". 💸
*   **AI Companion**: A chat widget that guides your journey.
*   **Smart Filtering**: Automatically hides prerequisites you've already mastered.

**🛠️ Tech Stack:**
*   React 19 + Vite 7
*   Agentic Logic (Mocked for Prototype)
*   Vanilla CSS (Glassmorphism & Dark Mode)

This project taught me how to think about **educational ROI**—treating learning time as an investment to be optimized.
