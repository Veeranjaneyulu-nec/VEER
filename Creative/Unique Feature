Implementation Plan - Educational Agent
Goal Description
Build a personalized learning path agent that integrates with course platforms, analyzes skill gaps, and optimizes learning paths using a "ScaleDown" methodology to compress content and personalize recommendations.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

"ScaleDown" is interpreted as a custom algorithmic component that filters and aggregates course content to reduce "noise" for the learner. I will mock the "compression" aspect by filtering metadata.

Proposed Changes
Core Architecture
The system will be a React-based SPA (Single Page Application) with a local service layer (simulating backend/agents).

[NEW] 
EduAgent
Root directory for the web application.
Data Layer (Mock)
[NEW] 
services/courseContent.js
Mocks APIs for Coursera/Udemy.
Returns large datasets of raw course data.
scaleDown Module
[NEW] 
agents/ScaleDown.js
Compression Logic: Reduces raw course objects to essential metadata (Title, Skills, Difficulty, Duration).
Personalization: Filters catalog based on learner profile (removes irrelevant/too easy/too hard courses).
Agents
[NEW] 
agents/SkillGapAnalyzer.js
Compares CurrentSkills vs TargetRole.
Outputs MissingSkills with priority weights.
[NEW] 
agents/PathOptimizer.js
Takes MissingSkills and CompressedCatalog (from ScaleDown).
Generates an ordered list of courses (The Path).
Respects prerequisites and time constraints.
[NEW] 
agents/PeerMatcher.js
Matches learners with similar paths/schedules for study groups.
UI Components
[NEW] 
components/Dashboard.jsx
Integrated view with AI enhancements.
[NEW] 
components/AIAssistant.jsx
AI Chat/Insight widget providing real-time feedback on learning path.
[NEW] 
components/MarketInsights.jsx
Visualizes salary data and job demand for the target role.
[NEW] 
components/CareerSimulator.jsx
Unique Feature: Interactive slider to adjust study hours/week.
Visualizes the "Time Machine": How study intensity impacts completion date and potential salary growth.
[NEW] 
components/PathVisualizer.jsx
Displays the learning path (Timeline/Graph view).
Interactive "Start Course" buttons.
[NEW] 
components/SkillChart.jsx
Visualizes skill gaps.
Verification Plan
Automated Tests
Unit tests for 
ScaleDown.js
 to verify compression ratio (aim for ~75% JSON size reduction).
Unit tests for 
PathOptimizer.js
 to ensure prerequisites are met.
Manual Verification
Run the web app.
Input a user profile (e.g., "Beginner Developer" wanting to be "Full Stack").
Verify the generated path makes sense and comes from the "integrated" platforms.
